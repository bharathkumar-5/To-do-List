# making

As a full-stack developer, I designed and developed a To-Do-List application that enhances task management and productivity. The app prioritizes tasks, breaks projects into manageable steps, and helps users stay organized with deadlines. Utilizing React for the front end and local storage for data persistence, I implemented a user-friendly interface that enables seamless interaction. This project demonstrates my ability to deliver functional, efficient solutions that improve user experience and streamline workflow.
